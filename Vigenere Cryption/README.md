### TASK

1. Implement encryption (decryption) using Vigenere method
2. Implement Kasiski examination for cryptoanalysis of encrypted text;
3. Investigate the dependence between probability of Kasiski test succesful attack and text's length
4. Investigate the dependence between probability of Kasiski test succesful attack and keyword length

## Dependency chart to show how keyword's length and text's length influence on Kasiski and frequency analysis attack's success
### x - text length
### y - keyword length
### f(x, y) - correctly decrypted text percentage
